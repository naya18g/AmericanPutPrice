get an aggregate of the Stock price. Finally that value of the stock price has been
used for calculating the Option Price.

## Data :- 
The ORACLE Corporation NYSE data has been extracted from the Yfinance.

## Technologies Used :-
i) Numpy
ii) Pandas
iii) Matplotlib
iv) Seaborn
v) Tensorflow
vi) Keras
vii) Scikit-learn
viii) Statsmodels
ix) Plotly
